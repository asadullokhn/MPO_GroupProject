# Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra (MPO) Ticketing Software

The Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra (MPO) requires an efficient event ticketing software solution for their concerts. This project is to build a software system that not only facilitates seat booking management for various concert halls but also provides comprehensive tracking of seat bookings. This system is aimed at enhancing the concert ticketing process and delivering a seamless experience for MPO's patrons.

## Introduction

This software is designed to help ticketing staff to manage ticket sales for various concerts efficiently. It will provide a list of available concerts, allowing the staff to select a specific concert and sell tickets. After the sale, the system will display the current seat availability for all halls.

The system is also designed with proper validation mechanisms to ensure data integrity and accuracy. The validation covers concert selection, seat availability, and user interactions.

## Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/asadullokhn/MPO_GroupProject.git
